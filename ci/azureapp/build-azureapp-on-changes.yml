      # For CD we are going to utlize the fact that "triggered" builds follow the same branch/revision that the job that has triggered them.
      # As such, we don't have to worry about newer commits appearing during the job - the pipeline chain will work with the same revision.
      # This also allows us to have a deterministic container versioning procedure, where we don't have to rely on build numbers.
